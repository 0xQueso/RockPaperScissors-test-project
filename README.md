# RockPaperScissors test project

You will create a smart contract named RockPaperScissors whereby:  
Alice and Bob play the classic game of rock, paper, scissors using their ETH.    
  
To enroll, each player needs to deposit the right Ether amount, possibly zero.  
To play, each player submits their unique move.  
The contract decides and rewards the winner with all Ether wagered.  
Of course there are many ways to implement this, so we leave that up to you.  
  
## Stretch Goals
Nice to have, but not necessary.
- Make it a utility whereby any 2 people can decide to play against each other.  
- Reduce gas costs as much as possible.
- Let players bet their previous winnings.  
- How can you entice players to play, knowing that they may have their funds stuck in the contract if they face an uncooperative player?  
- Include any tests using Hardhat.
  
Now fork this repo and do it! Good luck!
